# samdow's Instagram

This is an Instagram-like app where users can sign up and signed in users can post pictures to a feed 
that shows up when the app is opened. It was created from 
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE)
with Bootstraps extensions added from other tutorials.

Then, I adjusted the styling following parts of 
[this help guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp) and pattern 
matching from [my website repo](https://github.com/samdow/samdow.github.io).
