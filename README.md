# samdow's Instagram

This is an Instagram-like app where users can sign up and signed in users can post pictures to a feed 
that shows up when the app is opened. It was created from 
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE)
with Bootstraps extensions added from other tutorials.

Then, I adjusted the styling following parts of 
[this help guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp) and pattern 
matching from [my website repo](https://github.com/samdow/samdow.github.io).

## Use
When you first open the page, you will see the following screen:
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Full%20Page.png" width = "500">

### Registering
The first thing to do when you first get onto samdow's Instagram is to register your account. 
After clicking on the Register button, you will be redirected to a page with the same header and a 
main part that looks like:   
<img src = "https://github.com/samdow/InstagramApp/blob/master/images/Register.png" width = "200">  
After filling out this form, it will look something like:  
<img src = "https://github.com/samdow/InstagramApp/blob/master/images/Register%20Filled%20Out.png" width = "200">  
You will be immediately logged in and will be greeted with the following banner:  
<img src = "https://github.com/samdow/InstagramApp/blob/master/images/Register%20Successful.png" width = "700">  
as well as being redirected to the mainpage. Because you're now logged in, the header will now be:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Header%20User.png" width = "300">

### Logging In
If you have registered previously, you can login to your previously made account by clicking the login button.
You will be redirected to:  
<img src = "https://github.com/samdow/InstagramApp/blob/master/images/Login.png" width = "200">  
If your username or password is incorrect, you will get the following message:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Bad%20Password%20Banner.png" width = "700">  
Otherwise, you will be redirected to the mainpage. Because you're now logged in, the header will now be:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Header%20User.png" width = "300">

### Posting
If you want to make a new post, click the new New Post button to be redirected to the following page:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/New%20Post%20Form.png" width = "700">  
After filling out the form, it will look something like:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/New%20Post%20Filled%20Out.png" width = "700">  
Then, if you hit submit, you can get:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Post%20Posted.png" width = "400">  
If you go back to the mainpage, you will see:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/index.png" width = "400">  
This image, also includes the same image having been posted earlier without a description (you can see the 
bottom of the post above the one with a description). This shows that posts are added such that the newest posts are
at the bottom and the oldest posts are at the top.

### Logging Out
After you're done posting pictures to samdow's Instagram, you can sign out by clicking the Logout button. 
When you do, you will be greeted with:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Are%20you%20sure%3F.png" width = "500">  
If you click cancel, you will be put back on whatever page you were on before. If you click OK, you will see:  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdow/InstagramApp/master/images/Sign%20Out%20Successful.png" width = "700">

Currently, these are all the features that are offered for samdow's Instagram!

This branch was created to keep working on this app while maintaining the work done before Friday in a separate branch.
Everything on the master was done before the due date and everything here was done after.
